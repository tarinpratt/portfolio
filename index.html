            <section id="aboutMe">After 10 fulfilling years performing as a professional dancer in Los Angeles, 
                I decided to broaden my passion for creating and witnessing work come to life by entering the world of technology
                 and learning how to code. As a recent graduate from Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program, I have extensive experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, RESTful APIs, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL. 
                 Throughout my journey as a developer, I've discovered I'm most passionate about the user's experience and ensuring that my projects are responsive, 
                 useful, and easy to understand. The whole goal is to improve the lifestyle of the user! When I’m not transfixed by my dog or my computer screen, you can find me out and about, jamming to live music, dancing, hiking,
                  taking yoga, or trying to be discreet about how much cheese I’m devouring at a wine bar.</section>

                    <p>Inspired by mother who is battling breast cancer, MediGenda was created for anyone with a medical condition or disease that requires them to keep track of numerous, frequent appointments as well as medicinal intake. MediGenda was developed with the intent to track and log all upcoming and past appointments, billing information, and medicinal intake. Instead of constantly keeping track of tangible medical records, MediGenda makes it so that you can log and file everything in one place at anytime.</p>
